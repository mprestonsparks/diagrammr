UML diagrams cannot be created for code snippets as they do not contain enough information about the structure and relationships between classes and objects. UML diagrams are typically created to visualize the design and architecture of a software system, not individual functions or methods. It would therefore be more appropriate to create UML diagrams for the overall design and architecture of the software system in which this code snippet is a part of.
